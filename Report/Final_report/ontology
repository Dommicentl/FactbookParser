This ontology contains data from the following sources:
- CIA The World Factbook [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/]
- GTD Global Terrorist Database [http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/]
- Terrorist Organization Profiles [http://www.start.umd.edu/start/data_collections/tops/]

The ontology is based on the factbook ontology [http://www.daml.org/2001/12/factbook/factbook-ont]
but we made the following adjustments:
- GeographicCoordinates were moved to the data properties because we see this as a property instead of a relation to a coordinate individual.
- We renamed their object relation Government to hasGovernment.
- We removed the class latlon
- We removed the Code object property and used the data property

All data from the World Factbook is inserted in this ontology. We parsed the data as it was on
November 7. However not all data was available for all countries. If the data was on the site
you can find it in our ontology

The ontology is extended with the following classes and relation from the Global Terrorist
Database:
Classes:
  - Attack
  - Perpetrator
  - AttackType
  - VictimType
Object properties:
  - believesIn (Perpetrator -> Religion)
  - isFrom (Perpetrator -> Country)
  - executed (Perpetrator -> Attack)
  - executedBy (Attack -> Perpetrator)
  - occured (Attack -> Country)
  - hasVictim (Attack -> VictimType)
  - ofType (Attack -> AttackType)
Data properties:
  - name (All classes)
  - numberOfFatalities (Attack)
  - id (Attack)
  - date (Attack)
We created individuals for all classes we added with data from the global terrorist database.
We created the object relations executedBy, occured, hasVictim and ofType for every Attack
individual. However sometimes the value of executedBy, hasVictim and ofType can be an individual
named Other or Unknown. We didn't add relations of the executed type because it is just the
inverse of executedBy. So a reasoner can just create this relations. We also didn't create any
relations of the type believesIn or isFrom because the data wasn't available.

We also extended the ontology with information from the Terrorist Organization Profiles. We added the following classes and relations:
Classes:
  - Classification
Object properties:
  - hasClassification (Perpetrator -> Organizations)
  - hasBaseOfOperation (Perpetrator -> Country)
Data properties
  - name (All classes)
We added an individual for all classifications we found in the database. For every perpetrator we
also added hasClassification and hasBaseOfOperation relations for the Perpetrator for which we have data.
Not all perpetrators from the GTD database were in the Terrorist Profiles database. So there are
perpetrators that do not have a classification or bases of operations. 25% of the perpetrators have at
least one classification and one base. Perpetrators can have more classifications an/or bases.

The topology does not contain conflicts. It's tested without individuals.
